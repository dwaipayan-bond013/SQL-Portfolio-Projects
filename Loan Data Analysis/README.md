## üßæ Project Overview

This project involves analyzing loan data stored in a relational database using SQL. The dataset provides insights into borrower characteristics, loan performance, and financial risk indicators. The goal is to derive meaningful business intelligence to assist in credit risk assessment and loan portfolio management.

## üìà Insights and Recommendations

1. Total Loan Application

   ![](TotalLoanApplication.PNG)

```sql
SELECT FORMAT(COUNT(DISTINCT id),'N0') AS total_application FROM loan;
```

2. Total loan amount disbursed

   ![](LoanAmountDisbursed.PNG)

```sql
SELECT FORMAT(SUM(loan_amount),'N0') AS total_disbursed FROM loan;
```

3. MoM increase % in loan application

   ![](Percentagechangeinloan.PNG)

```sql
WITH T1 AS (
  SELECT YEAR(issue_date) AS year, MONTH(issue_date) AS month, COUNT(id) AS total_loan_application,
  LAG(COUNT(id), 1) OVER(ORDER BY MONTH(issue_date)) AS lagged_count
  FROM loan
  GROUP BY YEAR(issue_date), MONTH(issue_date)
)
SELECT *, ROUND((total_loan_application - lagged_count) * 100.0 / lagged_count, 2) AS percent_change FROM T1;
```

Business Insight:
- The loan amount has grown consistently over the year.From $250M in January to $539M in December, amounting to a total increase of ~115%
- Highest Monthly Growth: March saw the largest spike with a +17.15% increase over February
- Other strong growth months: December (+13.04%), November (+6.37%), and May‚ÄìJuly (6‚Äì7.6%)
- Negative Growth: February was the only month with a decline in loan issuance (-1.53%), possibly due to seasonality or economic factors
- Steady Growth Periods: From April to October, the growth remained positive and stable, indicating consistent demand and strong operational handling

Strategic Recommendation:
1. Investigate March Surge:
  - Analyze marketing campaigns, product launches, or policy changes in Q1 that could explain the March jump
  - Consider replicating effective strategies in Q1 of future years
2. Plan for Q4 Momentum:
  - Q4 (Oct‚ÄìDec) has strong, accelerating growth. Launch new loan products or promotions during this time to capitalize on increased demand
3. Mitigate Q1 Dip:
  - Address the February drop proactively through early-year campaigns, partnership promotions, or revised credit terms
4. Monitor Sustainability:
  - With loan volume more than doubling,  credit quality, risk assessment, and customer servicing scale needs to be ensured proportionally
5. Leverage Forecasting:
  - Use this trend data to forecast future monthly disbursements, helping with staffing, budgeting, and cash flow planning

4. MoM increase % in loan disbursement

   ![](Changeinloanamountdisbursed.PNG)

```sql
   WITH T1 AS (
  SELECT YEAR(issue_date) AS year, MONTH(issue_date) AS month, SUM(loan_amount) AS loan_amt_disbursed,
  LAG(SUM(loan_amount), 1) OVER(ORDER BY MONTH(issue_date)) AS lagged_amt
  FROM loan
  GROUP BY YEAR(issue_date), MONTH(issue_date)
)
SELECT *, ROUND((loan_amt_disbursed - lagged_amt) * 100.0 / lagged_amt, 2) AS percent_change FROM T1;
```

Business Insight:
- Strong Upward Trend:Loan disbursement grew from $250.3M in January to $539.8M in December ‚Äî a 115% increase over the year, indicating expanding demand and operational capacity.
- Top Growth Months: March saw the sharpest spike: +17.15%, indicating seasonal or campaign-driven momentum
- December also performed strongly: +13.04%, possibly reflecting year-end borrowing trends
- October and July also contributed significantly with +9.74% and +4.84% respectively
- Minor Setbacks: February experienced a drop of -1.53%, the only negative month ‚Äî likely due to seasonal or economic slowdown
- Sustained Growth Periods: Growth was consistent and healthy from April to November, staying within the +3% to +9% range

Business Startegy:
1. Leverage Seasonality Trends
 - March, October, and December are peak periods. Schedule major campaigns, product launches, or rate promotions during these months.
2. Optimize Operational Readiness
 - Prepare for high-disbursement months by: Scaling underwriting and customer support and strengthening fraud checks and risk controls
4. Align disbursed loan growth with application trends (from your earlier image) to understand conversion ratios, loan approval efficiency, bottlenecks in processing
5. Use this data to build a month-wise forecast model to plan: Cash flow, Resource allocation, Product roadmap

4. Total loan amount paid

   ![](Loanamtpaid.PNG)

5. MoM increase % in loan amount paid

   ![](MoMLoanAmtpaid.PNG)

```sql
WITH T1 AS (
  SELECT YEAR(issue_date) AS year, MONTH(issue_date) AS month, SUM(total_payment) AS loan_amt_paid,
  LAG(SUM(total_payment), 1) OVER(ORDER BY MONTH(issue_date)) AS lagged_loan_amt_paid
  FROM loan
  GROUP BY YEAR(issue_date), MONTH(issue_date)
)
SELECT *, ROUND((loan_amt_paid - lagged_loan_amt_paid) * 100.0 / lagged_loan_amt_paid, 2) AS percent_change FROM T1;
```

Business Insight:
- The loan amount paid increased from ~$275M in January to ~$580M in December, marking a 111% increase over the year
- This indicates strong loan repayment activity, possibly due to improved financial conditions, better collection mechanisms, or expanding customer base
- February and April showed minimal change (0.5% and 0.72% respectively)
- June (3.86%) and November (1.48%) were also lower than the annual average
- Except for one small dip in growth rate (June), the loan payments increased month over month, indicating stable and healthy customer repayment behavior

Business Strategy:
1. Capitalize on Year-End Momentum
   - The December spike (+15.84%) suggests borrowers are motivated to pay off loans before the year closes
   - Offer incentives like interest rebates or early payoff discounts in Q4
2. Stimulate early-year payments through:
   - Deferred interest offers for early settlement
   - Tax season tie-ins for Q1 to reduce stagnation like in Feb‚ÄìApril
3. Investigate Mid-Year Slowness
   - Months like April and June saw low repayment growth
   - Analyze whether this is due to seasonal employment, lower income periods, or operational inefficiencies in collections
4. Promote Auto-Debit and Reminders
To ensure repayment consistency, offer auto-pay options, late fee warnings, and SMS/email reminders.

6. Average DTI
